## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting the risk of Post-ERCP Pancreatitis (PEP) in patients with Common Bile Duct stones (CBDs). Utilizing six different machine learning algorithms, this project aims to identify the most effective model through both internal and external validation. The relationship between clinical characteristics of CBD patients and PEP risk has been thoroughly explored to enhance the predictive accuracy. The final model has been integrated into an online platform to assist clinicians in developing more effective medical strategies for patients at high risk of PEP.
